      <b><strong>HTML</strong></b>
    <p><b>HTML</b> documents display the information & contents on the web. <b>HTML</b> is the abbreviation of <em>'Hypertext Markup Language'</em>.  the documents contain text content which shows "what you see" and markup which shows "how it looks".

      <b><strong>Elements & Tags</strong></b>
        <p>HTML documents contain HTML <b>elements</b>. When creating an HTML document we use different types of elements by using HTML <b>tags</b> to tell the computer’s browser what to display.

      <b><strong>World Wide Web</strong></b>
        <p>The internet is comprised of computers that are network together to form the web. These computers communicate together. If you type a web address such as <a href='http://www.dogpile.com'>www.dogpile.com</a> a request called a <em> ‘HTTP Request’</em> is sent to a server. Then server computer then finds the HTML document and send it back to the computer that made the request. It displays the content in the computer’s browser..The internet is comprised of computers that are network together to form the web. These computers communicate together.

          <b><strong>Stupid Computers</strong></b>
        <p>Computers are not smart and they indeed stupid because they interpret instructions literally. If a programmer makes a very small mistake it can cause a huge problem in a program. They are not smart enough to figured out the mistake and fix it. 
        </p>  
        <br>
        <b><strong>HTML Elements: Inline vs Block</strong></b>
        <p>Elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b> on an HTML document. Inline elements will occupy the same line if there is room. Block elements take up a full like and forms an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
